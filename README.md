# ShopEase — Simple E-commerce Store

A lightweight full-stack e-commerce web application built for an internship submission.

**Stack:** Node.js + Express.js (backend) · HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript (frontend) · SQLite (database, via `better-sqlite3`)

No heavy frameworks, no ORM, no external database server required — everything runs from a single `npm install` + `npm start`.

---

## ✅ Features (matches task requirements)

- **Product listings** — home page grid with search and category filters
- **Product details page** — image, description, price, stock, quantity selector
- **Shopping cart** — add / update quantity / remove items, persists per logged-in user
- **Order processing** — checkout with shipping details, stock is validated & decremented, cart is cleared, order confirmation page
- **User registration / login** — passwords hashed with bcrypt, JWT-based authentication
- **Order history** — logged-in users can view all past orders and items
- **Database** — SQLite file (`data/store.db`) storing `users`, `products`, `cart_items`, `orders`, `order_items`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment
Copy the example env file and (optionally) change the JWT secret:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Seed sample products
```bash
npm run seed
```
This adds 8 sample products to the database (only runs if the table is empty).

### 4. Start the server
```bash
npm start
```
Visit **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

## 🔑 How authentication works

- On register/login, the server returns a **JWT** which the frontend stores in `localStorage`.
- Every cart/order request sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Protected routes (`/api/cart/*`, `/api/orders/*`) are guarded by `middleware/auth.js`.

## 🗄️ Database

Uses `better-sqlite3` — a fast, synchronous, file-based SQL database. No separate database server needs to be installed or configured, which keeps the backend intentionally lightweight while still being "real" relational SQL (foreign keys, transactions for order placement, etc.). The schema is created automatically the first time `server.js` runs.

Tables: `users`, `products`, `cart_items`, `orders`, `order_items`.

## 🧪 Quick API test (optional)

```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Jane Doe","email":"jane@example.com","password":"secret123"}'

# List products
curl http://localhost:3000/api/products
```

## 📌 Notes for submission

- Passwords are hashed with `bcryptjs` — never stored in plain text.
- Stock is checked and decremented atomically (inside a DB transaction) at checkout to prevent overselling.
- Frontend is plain HTML/CSS/JS (no build step) so it's easy to read and explain during a viva/demo.
- To reset all data, stop the server and delete `data/store.db*`, then run `npm run seed` again.
